# PyToSlang Translator
PyToSlang is a Python package that translates text abbreviations into their full meanings and back. It also changes slang words to emojis. Instructions/requirments for the creation of this package were referenced from the class course [instructions](./instructions.md).

## Features

- Convert full sentences to text abbreviations (e.g., "I don't know" ‚Üí "idk").
- Translate slang words into emojis (e.g., "goat" ‚Üí "üêê").
- Convert slang back into full words (e.g., "nm" ‚Üí "nothing much").
- Supports case-insensitive translations.

```python
from PyToSlang import full_to_slang

text = "I don't know what to do"
translated_text = full_to_slang(text)
print(translated_text)  # Output: "idk what to do"
